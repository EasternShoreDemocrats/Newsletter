                     </p><p>The July ACDC Meeting got off to a big start as Debra Wharton led a fantastic training session on the Accomack County Voter Registration and Absentee Ballot processes. Everyone learned so much!.</p><p>There was a lot of excitement around the upcoming special events in both Accomack and Northampton. There is an "Action Saturday" scheduled for Aug. 25 where our volunteers will make phone calls and do some door-to-door canvassing to build enthusiasm and participation in the Nov. elections.</p><p>There was much discussion about candidate yard signs and larger roadside signs. David Washington, Outreach for Luria Campaign, was in attendence and he listened to all the feedback and suggestions. Even better, it appears that the ACDC will be getting in 500 yard signs and a couple dozen roadside signs to distribute. David's Outreach focus is on the African-American community, churches and small businesses. He is very personable and helpful.</p><p>You can sign up to campaign for Elaine &amp; Kaine with the Democratic Coordinated Campaign on the Shore. The next Eastern Shore canvass event is from 10 AM to 5 PM on Saturday, August 25. There will be staging locations in Accomack and Northampton Counties.</p></div>

More on that later.</p><p>We were blessed to have Kara Moran speak to the group about <a href="http://www.emergeva.org/" target="_blank">Emerge Virginia</a>, a wonderful program that trains Democratic women to run for office with a seven-month program. Kara is a recent graduate of the program and she was very engaging and informative in talking about the great opportunities for women in Virginia politics. She admitted that we may see her running for office in a few short years and there is no doubt that Kara will be a very formidable and skilled candidate.</p></div>

</div><div>Miss Emmy's lived her entire life on the Shore. Walking–with or without a cane–was her main way of getting around. Born in Hopeton, and after moving to Mears, she walked–there were no buses for Black children–three miles to the two-room elementary school in Macedonia, outside Bloxom. And seven miles to the First Baptist church in Mappsville. And later, after moving to Parksley, walking to services at Adams United Methodist Church.&nbsp;</div></div>

                                <p class="mbr-fonts-style panel-text display-7">"Easy" isn't a word that comes to mind when you listen to Miss Emmy's life. She was born Emma Frank Downing–Frank after her great-grandfather, Emma after her great-grandmother, who was born into slavery.  Her childhood homes had no electricity, running water, or central heat. Clothes were scrubbed on a washboard, hung on a line, and ironed with a flatiron heated on the stove.
<br><br>	At age ten, she went to work in the fields, stripping fodder, digging potatoes, picking string beans, strawberries, cucumbers and tomatoes. The workday was sunup to sundown, 6 am to 8 pm.
<br><br>	If you could do an adult's work in the field, you earned $3 a day. The children and the babies came into the field with you. Children who were too young to work played in the shade. Babies lay in a basket which you pushed along as you worked the row. You took your lunch and theirs with you; there were no food trucks.
<br><br>	When Miss Emmy left the fields, she took a job at Jay Cee cleaners, working there until she was 73. Then she worked at the Perdue Poultry plant, in the Evisceration Department, where she and another woman gutted chickens coming at them via conveyor belt at the rate of 100 birds per minute.
<br><br>	No, "easy" isn't the word that comes to mind.
<br><br>	Leaving Perdue, she worked for the Carlton Byrd canning factory, cleaning the facility until it closed, then took a job at the home of D.L. and Elsie Webb. She cleaned for the Webbs until she retired at age 94.
<br><br>	Family is a huge part of her life. The daughter of Sally Warner Downing and Norwood Downing, she's personally raised four generations, has 7 grandchildren, 15 great-grandchildren, and 18 great-great-grandchildren, with a 19th on the way. And she's not the first centenarian in her family: her great-grandmother Emma Warner, ("Granny Lady,") a midwife who birthed all Miss Emmy's children, lived to 106.
<br><br>	Miss Emmy gives credit for her health and longevity to God and to not drinking or smoking. She married Preston Edwards in 1934. Preston died 30 years ago; their 3 sons are all now dead.
<br><br>	At 100, Miss Emmy has a lot of memories. Some of segregation, when Blacks could work in Shore restaurants, but not eat there. When Shore restrooms and movies and buses were segregated. When Jim Crow restrictions made it virtually impossible for a Black person to register to vote. Though John Kennedy is her favorite President, she could not vote for him due to Jim Crow. She cast her first vote as soon as the 1965 Voting Rights Act took effect, and has voted in every election since, usually walking to the polls, often with her children in tow, emphasizing the importance of the vote and the sacrifices it took to achieve that right.
<br><br>	She doesn't shy from speaking out locally. The children in the Leslie Trent Road neighborhood were expected to walk to school when the Parksley high school first opened, though most other kids rode buses. Miss Emmy called the School Board, and the neighborhood kids got a bus.
<br><br>	Many of her memories are warm and joyful, of family and a strong supporting community.
<br>Of butchering time, an all-day event, the men killing and butchering the hogs, the women cleaning chitterlings, making sausage, cutting pork chops and tenderloin, making souse cheese, cooking and talking up a storm. Even today, on Leslie Trent Road, the community watches out for Miss Emmy. If her screen door is banging, someone fixes it. If her lights are on when they should be off (or vice versa,) a neighbor notices.
<br><br>	Having lived through Jim Crow, she's very positive about the country today. She says she's been a Democrat "since I could scratch a pencil." Asked about Donald Trump: "I don't look at him."
<br><br>	As the chicken thaws in the sink, Karen reminds us that Miss Emmy still prepares dinner for the family Sundays and holidays. The meat may be turkey or ham or chicken, but the real highlights of the meal are her chicken and homemade dumplings, sweet and white potato pies, and sometimes homemade ice cream. In accommodation to her age, she now uses an electric ice cream churn instead of her hand-cranked one.
<br><br>	Karen says "She pretty much does it all. She'll let me bring something if I insist."&nbsp;<br></p>

<div>
</div><div>The move adds even more intrigue to a strange tale of political scheming that involves U.S. Rep. Scott Taylor’s campaign staff and its help in getting one of his opponents placed on the November ballot.
</div><div>
</div><div>Start with this fact: A man who died in April is among the “voters” who supposedly signed a petition in June to enable Shaun Brown to be on the ballot as an independent candidate — even though she is facing federal corruption charges and has virtually no chance of winning.
</div><div><br></div><div>Brown barely qualified to run, and might not have done so without the generous support of Taylor’s campaign team. At least four paid staffers collected signatures for her at the last minute.

Taylor says that the paid help — from people he prefers to call “volunteers” — had no other motive for their efforts than ensuring fundamental fairness in the democratic process.&nbsp;</span><br></div><div>
</div><div>“They wanted to volunteer to get Shaun on the ballot, and that’s cool, man,” Taylor said. “That’s democracy.”
</div><div>
</div><div>The notion that his campaign supporters would, on their own, rescue a struggling opponent in an unselfish defense of democracy does more than strain credulity. The fact that they were subsequently paid by the Taylor campaign provides a better clue as to their motives.
</div><div>
</div><div>Making a bad situation worse, a number of the signatures gathered by Taylor campaign workers and other supporters on behalf of Brown appear to be fraudulent. Without a doubt, R. Stuart Cake did not sign the petition, because he died two months before June 9, the date given beside his name.</div><div><br></div><div>His widow, Elizabeth, spoke on WHRV’s “HearSay with Cathy Lewis” radio show on Monday and called the use of his name “hurtful” and “disappointing.”</div></div>

<br>If signatures were forged on an election petition, it’s against the law. That’s why the appointment of the special prosecutor — longtime Roanoke Commonwealth’s Attorney Donald Caldwell — is necessary to sort out what happened, and who is responsible.
<br>
<br>Taylor initially said his campaign staff did nothing wrong, and he dismissed concerns about possible fraudulent signatures. He has since said that his campaign has zero tolerance for inappropriate activities and that it will cooperate with the investigation.
<br>
<br>But Taylor’s campaign should never have gotten involved in helping to place Brown on the ballot, which was an underhanded move to hurt Luria and tilt the election more in the Republican’s favor. And once Brown learned of the Taylor campaign’s involvement, she should have realized that she was part of a crass ploy to undercut a rival and distanced herself from the lists immediately.
<br>
<br>Maybe both sides thought no one would ever find out, but this is a good example of why so many people are disillusioned with politics today. And if all these allegations are proven, the shame of them will be that they further alienate an already disillusioned public from the government.
<br>
<br>The truth is, Americans have a right to expect more from their elected officials and from those who hope to represent them in public office. And, as the facts stand, the people of the 2nd Congressional District can be forgiven if they feel they’ve been let down.</p>

On a Friday afternoon in May, the Democratic nominee for governor of Georgia is at a union hall in Augusta, telling a story about her father, a college-educated black man who was relegated by his race to working at a shipyard in southern Mississippi in the 1970s. The family had one car, so Robert Abrams would sometimes hitchhike home in the middle of the night. When he didn’t come home one time, the rest of the family set out to pick him up and found him half-frozen by the side of the road, having given his coat to a homeless man. They asked why he, a poor man on a lonely road at night, would do such a thing. And Robert said, “Because I knew you were coming for me.”</p><p>You can hear scattered sniffles in the union hall as his daughter pauses. Then she roars: “I am coming for you, Georgia! Help me get there!”
</p><p>This kind of moment is one reason why Abrams, 44, has a chance to become America’s first black female governor.&nbsp;</p><div>

                <div class="col-12 col-md-6 pl-lg-4 mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Describe someone as “commanding the room” and you generally conjure an image of gravitas–a man, likely white, in a suit, emitting soaring oratory. Abrams is a big-boned, natural-haired, youthful-looking woman with a quizzical smile and a gap between her front teeth. She’s as likely to geek out about tax policy or Star Trek as she is to summon the spirit of justice. Yet when she speaks, all kinds of people–from black folks in rural communities to yuppie “resistance” moms around Atlanta to this crowd of rough-handed electrical workers–go quiet and listen. In a Democratic Party divided and desperate for fresh faces, Abrams is already becoming a national star.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">“I know talent when I see it,” says Valerie Jarrett, a former top adviser to Barack Obama, who tells me she sees the same kind of “unusual” skills in Abrams: “I see somebody who campaigns authentically, has character and integrity, is resilient and graceful, and who is able to take the long view and ignore a lot of noise.”</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"><strong><a href="http://time.com/5349541/stacey-abrams-georgia/" target="_blank">Click here to read the rest of this story about Stacey Abrams</a></strong><br></span><br><span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span></p></div>
