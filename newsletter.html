                <div class="col-12 col-md-6 pr-lg-4 mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p>Mary "Mama Girl" Onley, the beloved Eastern Shore of Virginia folk artist, died Saturday, August 19, 2018, after an illness.</p><p>Mary Onley, 64, of Painter, was known for her papier-mache sculptures and colorful paintings. Her works are in many private collections, in addition to a permanent collection at the American Visionary Arts Museum in Baltimore.
</p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">As news of her death spread, art lovers began posting photographs of her works with messages of remembrance on social media, including on her professional Facebook page, Mama-Girl FolkArt.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Onley started making her distinctive style of art more than a quarter-century ago, after a series of seizures and a diagnosis of severe allergies caused her to stop working in the fields of the Eastern Shore — she had done fieldwork for more than 22 years before that, since the age of 12, according to a 2016 article in the Eastern Shore News.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Looking for a new vocation, Onley began experimenting with a variant of papier-mache using strips of newspaper, Elmer's glue and acrylic paint.</span></p></div>
                <div class="col-12 col-md-6 pl-lg-4 mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p>Onley, who also was a pastor, said she called for guidance on the Spirit — the voice of God that would speak to her when she began working on a new piece of art.
</p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">"I said good Lord, give me something nobody's never done. Show me how to work this newspaper and glue," she said. "The Spirit showed me how to work the newspaper and glue and I started right from there, you know."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Mama Girl created her art in her home studio on a back road in Painter. She became well-known in the folk art community, often traveling to festivals and teaching classes.
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Speaking about Onley's art, "It has a soul to it," said Hampton Roads, Virginia, artist and restaurateur Sydney Meers in an episode of Curate757 that aired earlier this year on PBS.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">
</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Onley's grandson, Malcolm White, in February presented two American flag pins she had made to Gov. Ralph Northam and his wife at a gala in Onancock, during Northam's first official visit to the Eastern Shore after he was elected governor.&nbsp;</span></p></div>

The executive board includes LGs from Delaware, Montana, and Washington, The DLGA will function similarly to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee by funneling cash to standout candidates and coordinating liberal messaging from state to state. The DLGA promises to be proactive going into November’s midterms, the 2021 gubernatorial elections, and beyond.
</div><div>
</div><div>“We’re here not just to play defense,” Fairfax says. “And that’s a different posture from what we have seen in the past. I think it’s exactly the right moment in our American electorate to engage in this kind of robust national effort.”</div></div>
                <div class="col-12 col-md-6 pl-lg-4 mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><div>Currently, 14 states and one US territory have Democrats as lieutenant governors. DLGA’s main focus is to double or triple that number within the next four years. Fairfax says Virginia, which has moved from a reliably red state to one that’s elected Democrats at the top of the ticket the last two elections, can show other states how they might proceed.
</div><div>
</div><div>“Virginia is a state that shows you can be both progressive and pro-growth,” Fairfax says. “It’s a great model for the rest of the country where you can enact progressive policies and move the discussion forward.” He hopes that DLGA can help others mimic his own lieutenant gubernatorial race last November, which he won by five points.</div></div>

        <div class="media-container-row">
            <div class="row col-12 col-md-8">
                <div class="col-12 col-md-6 pr-lg-4 mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p>The last major primary night before the November election packed a major surprise: Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum edged out former Rep. Gwen Graham to capture the Florida Democratic gubernatorial nomination, taking a major step toward being Florida's first black governor.
</p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Gillum's victory -- particularly in a state as crucial to the presidential primary and general election process -- has lessons in it for any ambitious Democrat trying to understand the mentality and beliefs of the party base heading into 2020. Here are five.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">1. You can't be too liberal. Gillum was, without question, the choice of liberals in this race. Wealthy California businessman Tom Steyer, who has run ads nationally calling for President Donald Trump to be impeached, was an early supporter of Gillum's. So, too, were George Soros and Vermont democratic socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders. Gillum ran as an unapologetic progressive, advocating for single-payer health insurance and calling for Trump's impeachment.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">2. Younger is better. The Democratic Party base badly wants fresh faces. Its top three House leaders are all in their mid- to late-70s. The two most recognizable names in the 2020 sweepstakes at the moment -- Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden -- are 76 and 75, respectively. At 39, Gillum represents a younger generation of leaders, willing to go bold rather than bland on policy and unbound by the conventional wisdom of "how to win" that hold back many older politicians. While the 2020 top tier may begin as Biden, Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren (age 69), there appears to be significant room for younger candidates to emerge.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">3. Black candidates are winning. Gillum's victory is the third major victory for a black Democrat in a Democratic gubernatorial primary field in 2018, following on the heels of wins by former NAACP president Ben Jealous in Maryland earlier this year and state Rep. Stacey Abrams in Georgia. Gillum and Jealous both emerged from crowded primaries, while Abrams crushed fellow state legislator Stacey Evans, a white woman, in a one-on-one primary race.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">
None of that winning trio ran expressly as the "black" candidate in the field. (In Jealous' case, his leading opponent -- Rushern Baker -- was also black.) And all three demonstrated an ability to win votes outside of the African-American base within the Democratic Party.&nbsp;</span></p><div>
</div><p></p></div>
                <div class="col-12 col-md-6 pl-lg-4 mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">But their victories serve as a reminder of how potent the black vote is within the current incarnation of the Democratic Party. And how the likes of Sens. Kamala Harris (Calif.) and Cory Booker (N.J.) or former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick could benefit from that fact come 2020. 
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">4. Voters still love a powerful personal story. Gillum's background was compelling to voters, and he spoke of it often on the campaign trail. Here's the New Yorker's Benjamin Wallace-Wells on Gillum's life story: &nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"Last Sunday, Gillum spoke at St. Ruth Missionary Baptist Church, in Dania Beach, Florida. I was in a pew near the back. Over six feet tall, with a shaved head and handsome, Gillum took the pulpit and told the congregation about his life. He was born poor, in Miami. His mother was a school-bus driver and his father was a construction laborer. He was the fifth of seven children, and the first to graduate from high school."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">In one of his only campaign ads, Gillum turns to the camera and asks: "What's impossible? The son of a bus driver becoming mayor of the capital city? Is it impossible to come from nothing, be outspent 10-to-1 and win?" (In a longer digital-only ad, Gillum tells his personal story in a deeply compelling way.) &nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Time after time after time, voters remind us that they reward candidates who have powerful personal narratives that they tell in ways that touch people. Voters vote for a person much more than they vote for a series of policy positions. &nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;5. Money matters less than you think. One of the last vestiges of the old way of thinking about and analyzing politics is that fundraising power is determinative. It isn't. Gillum was drastically outspent by not only Graham but several self-funded candidates in the Florida race -- and still won. (Worth noting: Gillum did have financial support from both Steyer and Soros, which helped narrow the campaign spending gap somewhat.) &nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;Money doesn't make up for message. Money isn't a stand-in for genuine grassroots energy -- and can't purchase it either. There remains a fundraising threshold below which a candidate can't possibly hope to be competitive -- people need to know who you are before they go into the voting booth -- but that threshold is far lower than many establishment types believe it to be.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Andrew Gillum may be be exactly what the Democratic Party needs - a young, progressive man of the people.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;"></span></p></div>
