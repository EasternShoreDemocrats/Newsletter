                <div class="col-12 col-md-6 pr-lg-4 mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p>Elaine Luria is running against Republican incumbent Scott Taylor, who has launched a series of very negative and grossly misleading ads against Luria. 
</p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">You'd hope what you see on TV is true, but we all know that's not always the case. In politics it can be a challenge to separate fact from fiction. What makes this increasingly important is that this is a political season like no other, and Democrats in Congress smell blood in the water, hoping to take over the House and the Senate. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">This is really ironic because the first ad launched against Elaine Luria has a shark lurking, with words like danger, stealth, radical.  The shark is supposed to be the candidate. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The ad starts with scary music, and then the fin appears. It's slow moving and a deep voice states, "It's out there. You don't see it yet, but it's out there. Danger, lurking in the race for Congress. Stealth candidate Elaine Luria has quietly promised something radical and dangerous.  She backs a government takeover of health care that will make your health care costs skyrocket and deteriorate your quality of care. What you don't know about Elaine Luria should make you nervous."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">When Elaine Luria was shown the commercial she laughed. "You can actually see I am laughing at it," she said. "False implications", says the 2nd Congressional nominee who served in the Navy and is the target of this National Republican Congressional Committee political ad.
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">"I don't think my professional career and serving our country for 20 years supports that I am radical or dangerous or extreme in anyway." Luria wants you to know she served 20 years in the Navy. She commanded a combat unit with 400 sailors and she retired as a commander. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br></span><br></p><p></p></div>
                <div class="col-12 col-md-6 pl-lg-4 mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">In the ad, Taylor says that "Elaine Luria, running a negative campaign against Scott Taylor, who is a Navy Seal Iraq War combat veteran is a disgrace.  Worse, liberal Nancy Pelosi is pulling Luria's strings, bank rolling her attacks.  Because Pelosi  is desperate to rule as House Speaker, where with Luria's vote we will have higher taxes, lower wages, and fewer jobs. And if Nancy Pelosi puppet Elaine Luria wins, we lose."&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The implication is that Luria is a puppet supporting Democratic Congressional Leader Nancy Pelosi. Luria claims the only time she saw Pelosi was in a crowd of 300.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Luria further responds by saying "To make me look like I'm someone's puppet, I am not anyone's puppet, and if his opponent was a man he wouldn't have had him dancing around like a puppet with strings and a crown on." &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">She also takes this not-so-subtle dig at Taylor, "If you're voting 98 percent of the time with Trump, it kind of looks like he (Scott Taylor) is the puppet."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">A special prosecutor is still investigating Scott Taylor for campaign irregularities. Allegedly four of Taylor’s paid campaign staffers collected signatures at his direction and forged at least 80 names in the days leading up to the deadline to file the ballot petition sheets in order to push Shaun Brown over the 1,000-signature threshold.
</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">
</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">All of this has left a lingering impression that the "Remain Vigilant Virginia" commercials against Taylor would continue, and as new information develops in the case, new commercials will air, and that is bad news for Scott Taylor who only wants to talk about other issues instead of the ongoing forgery charges involving him and his staffers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><br></p><p></p></div>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p>The Coordinated Campaign Office in Exmore needs your help in phone banking and canvassing operations thru Election Day. If we truly want to create a Blue Wave it is imperative that we personally contact prospective voters in Accomack and Northampton to get them to the polls and voting Democratic. Campaign strategy says that winning is only possible if we directly contact and persuade enough voters. We need to contact over 3,000 more voters before Nov. 6. The Coordinated Campaign Office will be hosting Get Out The Vote weekends on Oct. 20-21, Oct. 27-28 and Nov. 3-4. To volunteer to help with phone bank or canvass operations at any time but especially on evenings or weekends, please call Ronnie Minkoff @ <a href="tel:203-5543529">203-554-3529</a> or Townsend Larmore @ <a href="tel:203-5543529">757-955-0828</a>. Townsend's email is <a href="mailto:townsend.larmore@virginiavictory.org">townsend.larmore@virginiavictory.org</a>.</p><p>High-quality phone banking and canvassing operations are consistent vote-winners. By far the most effective way to turn out voters is with high-quality conversations that urge them to vote. Just one personal conversation had a profound effect on a voter’s likelihood to go to the polls, boosting turnout by a noticeable percentage. Canvassing seems to work best when voters who don’t care much about politics engage in a genuine conversation about why voting is important. So, when canvassers rush through scripted interactions, just trying to cram their message into voters’ minds, the impacts they leave are minimal — voters might as well have been sitting through a television ad. On the other hand, research has consistently found that authentic interpersonal exchanges usually have sizable impacts. Be that person.</p></div>

                <div class="col-12 col-md-6 pr-lg-4 mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p>Elaine Luria, a Democrat running in the 2nd Congressional District, spoke in support of preserving the Affordable Care Act and addressing sea-level rise during a Williamsburg Kiwanis Club luncheon Oct 3, 2018..</p><p>Luria cast herself as a representative who would work to provide people with affordable health care.
</p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">“I think the job of our government is to create a health care system that’s both affordable and provides care for people across our community,” she said. “People are really struggling with the rising cost of health care and our current representative, our current Congress voted to take away health care.”&nbsp;</span></p><p>
</p><p>Luria was referring to a failed effort by Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, last year. Taylor voted in favor of the American Health Care Act, a partial repeal of the Affordable Care Act.
</p><p>
</p><p>The American Health Care Act as passed by the House would have ended the individual mandate and would have allowed no limit on the cost of insurance for people with pre-existing conditions.</p><p>Luria said she considered sea level rise a major concern for the area’s military presence.
</p></div>
                <div class="col-12 col-md-6 pl-lg-4 mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">“Sea level rise and recurrent flooding is a huge issue for this district. It has a huge impact on the military and the military’s ability to operate,” Luria said.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p></p><div>
</div><div>A 2014 study by the Department of Defense referred to climate change, which contributes to sea level rise, as a “threat multiplier,” which not only contributes to global instability by exasperating poverty, hunger and conflict but poses potential operational challenges, such as flooding, for installations in Hampton Roads and beyond.
</div><div>
</div><div>Luria opposes off-shore drilling in Virginia, saying doing so creates a hurdle to the military’s ability to operate and a potential ecological disaster if there’s an oil spill, which would damage the local economy.
</div><div>
</div><div>“You can’t take a carrier strike group and all the aircraft and escorts out there and complete the training that needs to be done while dodging oil platforms,” she said.</div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div>Luria also voiced support for devoting resources to education, specifically vocational training.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">“There’s a lot of jobs going unfilled because we’re not filling that gap for skills,” Luria said, adding that Newport News Shipbuilding wants to hire 7,000 more workers but there aren’t enough local welders or electricians to fill those jobs.</span></div><p></p></div>

                <ul>
                    <li>The highest number of absentee voting ballots requested/submitted so far is in VA-10 where incumbent Barbara Comstock (R) and Jennifer Wexton (D) are engaged in a very close race. Absentee voting has almost doubled from a similar point in 2017, with 7,508 last year and 14,015 this year. Women’s share of absentee ballots has gone from 51% in 2017 to 54% in 2018, The big change is youth voters (18-25) which has gone from 22% of ballots submitted to 36%. (1673 ballots to 5086 ballots). All these numbers favor Wexton.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li>Second highest number of absentee voting ballots requested/submitted so far is in VA-08 where Rep. Don Beyer (D) is heavily favored.</li>
                    <li>Third-highest number of absentee voting ballots requested/submitted so far, which is in strongly “blue” VA-11 and which also does not have a competitive House race, as Rep. Gerry Connolly (D) easily leads Jeff Dove (R).</li><li>Fourth-highest number is VA-07 with a highly competitive race between Dave Brat (R) and Abigail Spanberger (D). Interestingly, 29% of those VA-07 absentees were requested by young voters (aged 18-25)</li><li>Fifth-highest is VA-01 where Rep. Rob Wittman (R) faces off against Vangie Williams (D). Strangely, VA-01 and the other two solidly “red” districts in Virginia (VA-06 and VA-09) have very low numbers of absentees so far</li><li>Sixth-highest is VA-02, another very competitive, “purple” district, with Rep. Scott Taylor (R) up against former Navy Commander Elaine Luria (D). The number of absentees in VA-02 is far lower than in VA-10 (the Comstock vs. Wexton slugfest) which is kind of puzzling. Note that out of the 6,739 VA-02 absentees, about 58% are coming from Virginia Beach, which went 52%-47% for Ralph Northam last year. Another 7% are coming from Norfolk City, which went nearly 3:1 for Northam last year; and about 7% coming from Accomack County, which went 54%-46% for Ed Gillespie last year. Based on these numbers, VA-02 looks close right now.</li><li>VA-05, another “purple” district with a potentially competitive race (Leslie Cockburn (D) and Denver Riggleman (R). One good sign for Dems in VA-05 is that about 13% of absentees are coming from deep-blue Charlottesville, with another 28% coming from blue Albemarle County, which went 64%-35% for Ralph Northam last year.</li><li>VA-04 is strongly Democratic and not at all competitive (Rep. Donald McEachin (D). </li><li>VA-03 numbers are low even though it is strongly Democratic and heavily African American.</li><li>Finally, VA-09 has very low absentee numbers in one of the “Trumpiest” CDs anywhere.</li>
