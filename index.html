                <ul>
                    <li><strong>CORE VALUES</strong> - Luria refers to her core values as “security, equality and prosperity.” When elected, Elaine will be a fierce advocate for hardworking Tidewater families in Congress.</li>
                    <li><strong>JOBS &amp; WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT</strong> - She notes that a trained workforce is essential, as thousands of tech jobs are unfilled because of a lack of people to fill them. Also, 40 percent of the district’s jobs are directly or indirectly tied to the military, so “diversifying the economy is very important.”</li>
                    <li><strong>ECONOMY</strong> - Elaine serves as an elected member of the Hampton Roads Retail Alliance board, working tirelessly to help small businesses grow the Tidewater region’s local economy.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>HEALTH CARE</strong> - She feels that the Affordable Care Act is not a perfect solution for health care, but questions efforts to repeal it “without any suitable substitute,” saying it is creating “turmoil and uncertainty.” Luria said “there are options we can and should explore that would make the system better and more affordable,” such as allowing people to opt in to Medicare at an earlier age, “reducing the risk in the overall pool.” She is a pro-choice champion committed to expanding access to affordable, quality health care, and she will fight back against attempts to undo the progress we’ve worked so hard to make.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>MILITARY &amp; SECURITY</strong> - Luria is a strong proponent who believes that we need to support and grow the burgeoning military presence in Virginia’s Second Congressional District. The Norfolk area has the world’s largest naval base, along with NASA’s Langley Research Center and Langley Air Force Base, and is the second-largest port on the East Coast.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>SCIENCE &amp; ENVIRONMENT</strong> - Elaine dedicated her career to public service to build a safer, stronger, and fairer society for this generation and the next, and as an engineer, she will fight back against the dangerous anti-science agenda that threatens our future. “Security means that we must protect our environment — so that we, along with future generations, can breathe fresh air and drink clean water. In recent years, local flooding has gone from “an occasional nuisance to a frequent and recurring problem,” and action is needed to protect the area. The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) Action Fund, which works to elect candidates who will support sound environmental policies, announced its endorsement of Elaine Luria (VA-02) for Congress.</li><li><strong>GUN VIOLENCE</strong> - As a Navy commander, Elaine Luria’s chief mission was to keep our country safe. As a candidate for Virginia’s 2nd district, her mission has not changed. Elaine has made gun violence prevention a top priority, supporting repeal of the Dickey Amendment,universal background checks, and a ban on bump stocks and assault rifles. Giffords, the gun safety organization founded by former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords and Captain Mark Kelly, announced its endorsement of Elaine Luria, candidate for Virginia’s 2nd congressional district. Luria is one of 11 candidates Giffords endorsed.</li></ul><ul>

            <div class="mbr-text col-12 col-md-8 mbr-fonts-style display-7"><p><strong>Political scientists have studied ways to change people’s voting behavior. These four methods seem to stand out in terms of being most effective.</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>1) Educate early and well. </strong>&nbsp;Messages that people receive early in life have a strong impact on whether people vote, notes Donald Green. He’s a political scientist at Columbia University in New York City. Parents and teachers should therefore let kids know “voting is important,” he argues. “It’s what makes you a functioning adult.” Teachers might help deliver this message in classes where students learn about how their country and government functions. That happened to me in high school when my own teacher one day begged me and my classmates to vote.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">People with college degrees are also more likely to vote.</span></div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>2) Peer pressure.</strong> &nbsp; A healthy dose of name and shame can have a big effect on Election Day. Green and his colleagues demonstrated this in a study published in 2008 in American Political Science Review. They applied a little social pressure to voters.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Right before Michigan’s 2006 Republican primary, the researchers selected a group of 180,000 potential voters. They mailed about 20,000 voters a letter asking them to do their “civic duty” and vote. They mailed another 20,000 a different letter. It asked them to do their civic duty, but added that they were being studied — and that their votes were a matter of public record. (In some states, such as Michigan, voting records are publicly available after an election.) A third group got the same messages as the second group. But they also got a note that showed them their previous voting record, and the previous voting records of the people in their household. A fourth group got the same information as the third group, as well as being shown the publicly available voting records of their neighbors. The last 99,000 people or so were a control — they got no mailings at all.</span></div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><span style="font-size: 1rem;">After all the votes were counted, the scientists saw a 1.8 percentage point increase in turnout by people who had been reminded to vote over those who did not get such a mailing. For the group told their votes were a matter of public record, there was a 2.5 percentage point increase. But the biggest increase were among those shown voting records. Turnout increased by 4.9 percentage points among people shown their previous voting records. And if voters were also shown their neighbors voting records, turnout at the polls rose a whopping 8.1 percentage points.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Although shaming may get out the vote, Green cautions that it likely also burns bridges. “I think it produces backlash,” he says. In the 2008 study, many of the people who received the letter that showed the voting records of their neighbors called the number on the mailing and asked to be left alone.</span></div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>3) Healthy competition.</strong> &nbsp;“People are going to participate when they think they are going to make a difference,” says Eyal Winter. An economist, he works at the University of Leicester in England and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel. He notes that there is higher voter turnout when an election is close and there’s no telling who might win. Winter compares elections to football or baseball games. When two close rivals face off, their competitions will draw much bigger crowds than when one team is sure to roll right over another.</div><div><br></div><div>  
</div><div>
</div><div>To find out whether a close election might make more people vote than a race where one politician is far behind another, Winter and his colleague looked at U.S. elections for state governors from 1990 to 2005. When surveys before the election showed that results were likely to be very close, voter turnout increased. Why? People now felt their vote might make a bigger difference.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">More voters also turned out for the side with the slight majority in the poll.</span></div><div><br></div><div>
</div><div>
</div><div><strong>4) The personal touch.</strong> &nbsp; Hundreds of studies have been done on what gets people to vote. Some of the studies might be partisan — focusing on people who support a particular party. Others might focus on both major parties or even on people in general. Such research has probed everything from the how much money to spend on voicemail messages to crafting the ideal subject line for an email.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">The most effective methods employ face-to-face and one-on-one discussions of the candidates. For politicians this means walking door to door (or having volunteers do it).&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">But maybe someone just wants to get a sister or friend to vote. In that case, Green says the most effective message might be to convey your own enthusiasm for the candidates, the issues and how much you’d like to see that person vote.</span></div><p></p></div>
